# OOP-Assignment-3-Cinema-Booking
This is a github repository for my Object Orientated Programming assignment 3 for Year 2. We are required to use the techniques we have covered in Object orientated programming. We have chosen to do a Cinema Movie Booking application. Our group consisted of three members Steve Martin, Gary McNulty and Dylan Kieran.

## Key Features
- Cohesive Appearance
- Docket
- Receipt printing to a file
- Database Queries for Seating and Movie Information

## Idea
Our concept was to have a touch screens located in a movie theater where customers can go in and self book what movie they want to see, tickets, food and drink, and seating. They would then checkout and it will print the reciept out for them and if they ordered food they would simply go up to the food stalls and retrieve their order. 

### Welcome Screen
This screen has a clean and simple layout to be appealing to the users. It's designed to catch the users eye to persuade the users into booking through the application. When we load into the application it starts playing Cast Away by Etherwood. We included this music to appeal to all senses to attract the customer in. When the Book Now button is pressed the screen changes to the Movie Selection Screen.

### Movie Selection Screen
This screen is where you select your chosen movie and will be brought to the Movie Information Screen. When you hover over a movie it is highlighted and that is the button. The buttons are an image loaded and resized to fit the button size.

### Movie Information Screen
In our Movie Information Screen we load information from our created database and format it to the screen. We load in the movie Title, Rating, Index and Genre. We then have a movie description on this page. If you want to watch that movie there is an option to add tickets to your docket. You can select either a Adult, Student or Child ticket and the price will be added to your docket. From this screen you can either go back to the Movie Selection Screen where you can choose a different movie or you can go to the Food Selection Screen where you can add food and drinks to your order.

### Food Selection Screen
In this screen you have to pick your food and drinks. When you select you chosen food and drinks they are added to your docket along with your tickets and also added to your total price to pay. You can reset the food to pick different foods and this will reset the total to just the tickets. You choose your foods by clicking on the picture of them. From here you can go back to the Movie Select Screen and you can proceed to the Seat Selection Screen where you can choose your seat.

### End Screen
In the final screen you are greeted with a thank you and a button that brings you back to the welcome screen for the next customer to book their tickets.
