# OOP-Assignment-3-Cinema-Booking
This is a github repository for my Object Orientated Programming assignment 3 for Year 2. We are required to use the techniques we have covered in Object orientated programming. We have chosen to do a Cinema booking application.

# Welcome Screen
This screen has a clean and simple layout to be appealing to the users. It's designed to catch the users eye to persuade the users into trying them. As this screen appears it loads an appropriate tune and begins playing it throughout the users time using it. Song used - Etherwood - Cast Away.

# Movie Selection Screen
This screen is where you select your chosen movie and will be brought to the Movie Information Screen. When you hover over a movie it is highlighted and that is the button. The buttons are an image loaded and resized to fit the button size. 

# Movie Information Screen
In our Movie Information Screen we load information from our created database and format it to the screen. We load in the movie Title, Rating, Index and Genre. We then have a movie description on this page. If you want to watch that movie there is an option to add tickets to your docket. You can select either a Adult, Student or Child ticket and the price will be added to your docket. From this screen you can either go back to the Movie Selection Screen where you can choose a different movie or you can go to the Food Selection Screen where you can add food and drinks to your order.

# Food Selection Screen
In this screen you have to pick your food and drinks. When you select you chosen food and drinks they are added to your docket along with your tickets and also added to your total price to pay. You can reset the food to pick different foods and this will reset the total to just the tickets. You choose your foods by clicking on the picture of them. From here you can go back to the Movie Select Screen and you can proceed to the Seat Selection Screen where you can choose your seat.
